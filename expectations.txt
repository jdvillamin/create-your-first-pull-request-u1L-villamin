First, I expect that I will be learning enough about web programming that I am able to apply my learnings to my future projects. Second, I expect that the course will have a fair amount of workload, duration of deadlines, and grading. Third, for myself, I expect to put time and effort (even beyond class hours) for studying and practicing web programming. Fourth, I expect that my professors will teach clearly and efficiently. And lastly, I expect that not only my programming and development skills will be developed, but also my soft skills, especially that we have a group project.
