First, I expect that I will be learning enough about web programming that I will be able to apply my learnings to my future projects. Second, I expect that the course will have a fair amount of workload, duration of deadlines, and grading. Third, I expect to put time and effort (even beyond class hours) into studying and practicing web programming. Fourth, I expect that my professors will teach clearly and efficiently. And lastly, I expect that not only my programming and development skills will be developed, but also my soft skills, especially since we have a group project.
I agree that the topics to be taught in this course would serve beneficial in our future projects. Hence, your second point is valid as most beneficial things in life often come with a challenge or a difficult hurdle to overcome. Consequently and similar to you, I would do my best and try to learn as much with the guidance of the professor and hope to hone not only my programming skills, but also my soft skills.
